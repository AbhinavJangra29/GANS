#Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Welcome to the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)! This repository explores the fascinating field of GANs, a type of machine learning model that's great at generating new content, whether it's images, text, or more.

What are GANs?
At their core, GANs consist of two neural networks - a Generator and a Discriminator - engaged in a continuous game. The Generator creates new content, and the Discriminator's job is to distinguish between real and generated content. As they learn and improve, the Generator gets better at creating realistic content, and the Discriminator becomes more discerning.

Types of GANs Covered
1. Simple GAN
The basic GAN architecture involves a straightforward Generator-Discriminator setup. The Generator creates data, and the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples.

2. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
DCGAN enhances the basic GAN by incorporating deep convolutional networks. This is especially powerful for image generation tasks, allowing the model to learn hierarchical features effectively.

3. WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)
WGAN introduces a new way to train GANs by using Wasserstein distance, providing more stable training and better gradient flow. This helps overcome some of the training challenges faced by traditional GANs.

4. Pix2Pix
Pix2Pix is a type of GAN used for image-to-image translation. It learns to map input images to output images in a supervised manner. For example, turning satellite images into maps or black-and-white photos into color.

5. CycleGAN
CycleGAN extends GANs for unpaired image translation. It can learn to transform images from one domain to another without requiring paired examples during training. Think turning horses into zebras without needing images of the same scene in both styles.
